# Project Overview

It is basically a Dice game bulit by keeping three goals in mind:
- Getting stronger in writing JS.
- Teaching myself DOM and Handling Events in JS.
- Build a simple, fun and pretty looking app.

It uses ES6 JavaScript and its concepts like event handling, functions, loops and DOM manipulation.
